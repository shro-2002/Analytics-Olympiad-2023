# Analytics Olympiad 3.0 - Predicting Customer Loan Default

Welcome to the third edition of Analytics Olympiad hosted by The Academy of Continuing Education at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence in collaboration with MachineHack. This month-long event, running from August 24 to September 24, 2023, offers data scientists and machine learning professionals a platform to showcase their predictive analytics skills and a chance to win up to INR 1 lakh.

## Theme

Analytics Olympiad 3.0 revolves around the theme of "Predicting Customer Loan Default." This challenge focuses on providing valuable insights for the banking, finance, insurance (BFSI), and fintech industry by accurately predicting customer loan default.

## Problem Statement

In today's financial landscape, the ability to predict customer loan default is crucial for reducing risk and maintaining a healthy lending portfolio. Participants are tasked with developing machine learning models to determine the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. 

### Data Provided

Contestants will be given access to:

- Credit history
- Payment behavior data
- Account details

These data points will serve as the foundation for building predictive models, addressing a significant real-world challenge faced by financial institutions.
